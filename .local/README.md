# `.local/`

This directory is reserved for machine-local caches and helper output that
should not be committed. Keeping a README in place documents the intent while
allowing the folder itself to stay ignored in Git.

Common examples include downloaded datasets, temporary CLI captures, or other
artifacts generated during runbook execution. Feel free to add additional notes
here if you introduce new tooling that relies on `.local/`.
